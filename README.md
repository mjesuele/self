# Self

Self is a web application built with TypeScript and React that allows a user to create a timeline of
the significant events of their life.

The code for the prototype is exposed as a demonstration of several concepts and patterns, such as
the use of TypeScript with React, testing business logic and React components, and the repository
pattern.

This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
